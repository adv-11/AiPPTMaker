1. Introduce `imageErrorStates` to track image loading errors.
2. Create a function `handleImageError` to manage image error states.
3. Implement `setImageErrorStates`.
4. Conditionally render the error placeholder based on `imageErrorStates`.
5. Reset the error state for a slide when `currentSlideIndex` changes.
6. Update the `onError` handler to set the error state instead of direct DOM manipulation.
7. Ensure the `ImageOff` icon and error text are displayed when an image fails to load.
8. Remove direct DOM manipulation from the `onError` handler.
9. Initialize `imageErrorStates` as an empty object.
10. Added a `key` to the `Image` component to force re-render and re-try loading when slide changes.
